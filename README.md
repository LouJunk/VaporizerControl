Why?

 - The app from the vendor is to slow in showing battery state. I especilally disliked that a progress indicator always visually blocked the for me most important info - the battery state
 - As the app was not free software there was no fdroid version and there are some Android users that just run free software ( respect! ) So e.g. Richard Stallman can now use the device
 - possible wear extension ( I could imagine this handy - but I have no wear device yet )
 - in the states where weed is legal we could have presettings for THC
 - perhaps I get some samples to try in my crafty;-)
